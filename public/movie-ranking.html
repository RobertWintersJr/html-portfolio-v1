        <h2>This list is based on objective truth.</h2>
        <hr>
            <h3>It's A Wonderful Life (1947)</h3>
                <p>A classic film about love of family and friends.</p>
                <p>"No man is a failure who has friends"</p>
            <h3>Rocky IV (1985)</h3>
                <p>The theme of 'Man vs Man' alongside the theme of 'Man vs Self' make this a movie for all-time.</p>
                <p>"Well, the truth is sometimes I do get a little scared when I'm in that ring and when I'm going to
                 get hit or when my arm hurts so much I can't even lift it and I'm thinking I wish this guy hit me 
                 in the chin so I won't feel nothing anymore then there's another side that comes out that wants 
                 to take more wants to go one more round because if I go one more round when you don't think you 
                 can, that makes all the difference in your life"</p>
            <h3>Fight Club (1999)</h3>
                <p>This is the type of movie that can only be fully experienced the first time.</p>
                <p>"I see in the fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential 
                and I see squandering. G-- D--- it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables, slaves with 
                white collars, advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy s--- 
                we don't need. We're the middle children of the history man, no purpose or place, we have no Great war, 
                no Great depression, our great war is a spiritual war, our great depression is our lives, we've been 
                all raised by television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars, 
                but we won't and we're slowly learning that fact. and we're very very pissed off.</p>
